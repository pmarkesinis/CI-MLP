# CI-MLP
Computational Intelligence - Multilayer Perceptron 

During this MLP project, I collaborated with three colleagues to build a complete neural network from the ground up.
Our developed network was capable of accurately categorizing a set of 10 features into seven distinct classes.
Additionally, we implemented back-propagation algorithms for effective training. The entire project was implemented using Python.
